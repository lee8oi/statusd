# Statusd is a reimagining of Seend script designed to track users by storing
# thier latest activity & hostmask. Activities include joined, parted, kicked,
# quit, nick change, and action. If name specified is not found a pattern
# search will be performed instead and results displayed. Script also includes
# the ability to search for nicks by hostmask using the host parameter. As well
# as an automatic backup system that saves on .die, restart, timed intervals,
# and by backup trigger.
#
# *Configurable options include: command trigger, backup trigger, backupfile
# location/name, backup intervals, log backups, and use current channel.
#
# Initial channel setup:
# (starts logging and enables public status command. Run in partyline.)
# .chanset #channel +statusd
#
# Public command syntax:
# !status <nick> ?channel?
# !status host <hostmask>
#
# Example Usage:
# (public)
# <lee8oi> !status lee8oi
# <dukelovett>  lee8oi spoke in #dukelovett 4 minutes 21 seconds ago. Message:
# I thought it was a great idea so I got started.
# <lee8oi> !status lee8oi #dukelovett2
# <dukelovett> lee8oi joined #dukelovett2 5 minutes 59 seconds ago.
# <lee8oi> !status host *lee*
