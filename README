# Statusd is a re-imagining of Seend script that was designed to track users
# latest status in any channels with the correct channel flag set. Users can
# check the status of a nick in a specific channel or check for most recent
# activity regardless of channel. If nick specified is not found the script
# will search for the pattern in existing names. Status checks can be done in 
# channel or query/msg. Script also includes automatic backup system that saves 
# on .die, restart, timed intervals, and by backup trigger in msg/query.
#
# Status's tracked: Joined, Parted, Kicked, Quit, Nick Change, Spoke, and Action.
