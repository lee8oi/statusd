#
# Status oriented rebuild of Seend v1.8.3
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Statusd is a reimagining of Seend script designed to track users by storing
# thier latest activity & hostmask. Activities include joined, parted, kicked,
# quit, nick change, spoke, and action. If name specified is not found a pattern
# search will be performed instead and results displayed. Script also includes
# the ability to search for nicks by hostmask using the host parameter. As well
# as an automatic backup system that saves on .die, restart, timed intervals.
#
# *Configuration options can be changed using the dcc command 'statusd'.
# Configurable options include all listed in configuration section.
# 
# Initial channel setup:
# (starts logging and enables public status command. Run in partyline.)
# .chanset #channel +statusd
#
# Public command syntax:
# !status <nick> ?channel?
# !status host <hostmask>
#
# DCC command syntax:
# (omitting value and/or option displays help)
# .statusd set ?option? ?value?
# .statusd ?load|store?
#
# Example Usage:
# (public)
# <lee8oi> !status lee8oi
# <dukelovett>  lee8oi spoke in #dukelovett 4 minutes 21 seconds ago. Message:
# I thought it was a great idea so I got started.
# <lee8oi> !status lee8oi #dukelovett2
# <dukelovett> lee8oi joined #dukelovett2 5 minutes 59 seconds ago.
# <lee8oi> !status host *lee*
# <dukelovett> *lee* host matches the following nicks: lee8oi
#
# (DCC/partyline)
# <lee8oi> .statusd set
# <dukelovett> Configurable options: trigger backupfile
# interval logbackups use_current_chan. Setting config without a value shows
# help. ie: '.statusd set trigger' for trigger help.
# <lee8oi> .statusd set trigger
# <dukelovett> Usage: .statusd set trigger <string>
# <lee8oi> .statusd set trigger !seen
# <dukelovett> Statusd trigger changed to: !seen

# Thanks: drsprite. This script was concieved from your suggestions & comments.
#
# Updates:
# v0.3
#  1.Added configuration backup system. Script configuration settings are now
#  saved & restored through the backup system as well as with '.statusd load'
#  and '.statusd store' commands via dcc/partyline.
#  2.Removed backup_trigger & its configuration options since backups can be
#  performed via dcc/partyline. Also a couple other minor fixes.
